## Urgent
~~1. FP score function~~  
~~2. FP evaluator (partially done)~~  
~~3. Fix parser (BV constants, conversions to core language, etc.)~~  
4. Try Z3 SLS and compare performance  
5. Try FP->BV on Z3 SLS 
6. add tests to submodule  
7. add types to score functions (they should be rational rather than floating point)

## Non-urgent
1. SLS heuristics in the original paper
